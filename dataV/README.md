## Introduction
Data visualization quickly allows you to gain valuable insight into the dynamic and massive data in todayâ€™s challenging business environment. Data visualization presents large amounts of data in a more clear and understandable way when compared with traditional charts and data dashboards. It helps you discover and diagnose business problems and opportunities by using interactive video walls.

DataV of Alibaba is a powerful and accessible data visualization tool featuring various visualization templates allowing non-technical personnel to create professional data visualizations through a graphical interface. DataV perfectly satisfies the data presentation demands of exhibitions, business monitoring, risk warning, and geographic information analysis.

## Features

### Various scenario templates

The most difficult part of data visualization design lies in understanding the structural hierarchy and the relationship between various sources of data in only one single article. This involves comprehensive use of colors, layouts, and charts to create a successful visualization. DataV provides multiple templates for scenarios including a control center, geographical analysis, real-time monitoring, reporting, presentation, and many others. Your data visualization presentation can have a high level of design and impact without engaging a professional designer.
